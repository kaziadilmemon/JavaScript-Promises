This repository contains examples and explanations of JavaScript promises

# What are Promises?
Promises are objects used for handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They represent a value that may be available in the future, allowing you to work with asynchronous code in a more organized and readable manner. Promises provide a way to handle the completion or failure of asynchronous operations, making it easier to write asynchronous code that behaves predictably.
